## What is OOP?

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the con- cept of wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that data, into special bundles called objects, which are construct- ed from a set of “blueprints”, defined by a programmer, called classes.

## What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is a model of a real-world object or phenomenon, limited to a specific context, which represents all details rele- vant to this context with high accuracy and omits all the rest.

## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the ability of an object to hide parts of its state and behaviors from other objects, exposing only a limit- ed interface to the rest of the program.
